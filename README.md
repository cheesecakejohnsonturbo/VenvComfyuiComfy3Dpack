This is a .bat to install ComfyUI using a venv environment (Requires that you install python 3.12 as it is required by Comfy3DPack) 
Once comfy is installed, copy the 2 extra bats in the custom_nodes folder and run VenvInstallComfy3DPack.bat
If the last stage fails, run VenvInstallComfy3DPack finalize when failed.bat but it probably won't be necessary.
Don't hesitate to suggest improvements and report bugs.
